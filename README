irc-logs.lisp [-n | -h] [-lisp yy.mm.dd] [-sbcl yy.mm.dd]

Fetches #lisp and #sbcl logs using curl to subdirectories named lisp/ and
sbcl/ respectively. If some logs already exist, fetches all later ones --
otherwise logs start from the current month, or the specified starting
date if one is provided.

#lisp logs are fetched from http://tunes.org/~~nef/logs/lisp/, and #sbcl logs
from http://ccl.clozure.com/irc-logs/sbcl/.

Options:

 -n     Dry run. Don't actually do anything, merely show what would be fetched.

 -lisp  Starting date of #lisp logs.

 -sbcl  Starting date of #sbcl logs.
